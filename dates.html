<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Dates</h1>

</div>


<p>Here are my thoughts on all the dates we’ve ever been on and how much
I loved each of them! Also some bonus thoughts on how much I love
you.</p>
<div id="date-1-daddy-issues" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 1: Daddy Issues</h3>
<p>Our first date! It’s wild to think about how long ago this was now.
and how scared we were of getting caught when Allie was sitting right in
front of us and Kat and Cameron were nearby but we held hands the whole
time anyway. It was kinda silly that we tried to hide that under a
jacket. I’m really glad you invited me to this because it was a super
funny show and I had a great time watching it with you. It was also nice
to eat pizza outside on a bench with you even though we ran into all of
ADP at Mondo somehow. I still have “dinner with Elias :)” and “ice cream
with Elias :)” in my calendar from that date. That was such a nice
experience all around and a wonderful first date with you. I feel like
it set the tone for how funny and wonderful and nice our relationship
has been since then. I love you so much.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-2-wsa-debate-moderation" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 2: WSA Debate Moderation</h3>
<p>This was such a silly suggestion for a date but I think that’s what
made it so fun, especially since our date ended up being published in
The Argus then, so we were such a good couple as to even be newsworthy.
I really enjoyed coming up with silly questions with you and dressing up
and getting to sit with each other. It’s nice to be silly with you. It
was also fun to be a bit serious and do a debate and then talk about how
we felt about it (even though both of us forgot to actually vote in the
end oops). I really like débriefing with you after we do stuff together.
I always love hearing how you felt about stuff and seeing what we both
liked and both disliked and where we differ too. I love your thoughts so
much. And your silly jokes. You make me laugh so much.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-3-er-trip" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 3: ER Trip</h3>
<p>Thank you for thinking to make this a date to try and make things
feel a lot less scary. It was kinda scary to go back to the ER, and I
was worried about us after how bad this weekend was and the dumb stuff I
did to get us into that place. It meant a lot to me that you still took
me to the ER even though things were bad for you too. and that you did
your best to spend time with me there even though I had to get a covid
test and they kicked you out for that part. I’m sorry I have so many
medical issues but thank you for always being so kind about them. You’re
really good to me. Even so I hope we don’t have another ER date. I love
spending time with you anywhere but maybe we should go somewhere else
next time.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-4-space-joe" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 4: Space Joe</h3>
<p>My main memory from this is how incredibly freezing we were and how
much we needed to cuddle for warmth when we got back to your room. As
hellish as that was it was really nice to cuddle you and be so close to
you like that. I really like being super close to you, even when it’s
for sad reasons like being cold. And Joe is always a funny actor. I’m
very glad that you started the trend of going to Joes for dates because
I feel like those are always good. You always have such good date ideas.
Thank you for being so thoughtful and so creative and for bringing to me
to do such amaazing and fun things.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-5-dr.-stranger" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 5: Dr. Stranger</h3>
<p>When I was talking about needing to go with someone to see this
because I was scared of the horror tag the first time I brought up the
movie, before we were even together, I was hoping you would be the one
to come with me. And when it ended up being a bit spooky I was really
happy you were there with me and you let me squeeze your hand and be
close to you and feel protected. You’re my knight in shining armor :)
And it was a good movie. I really like when we watch movies and tv shows
together, whether it’s in the movie theatre or just at home in bed. It’s
nice to be able to talk to you about them and cuddle you or hold hands
or eat ice cream.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-6-adp-reunion" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 6: ADP Reunion</h3>
<p>This was such a fun time. I know it was a lot of work too and I’m
sorry you had to do so much to set it up and I wish I could’ve helped
more but I’m glad I was around to help as much as I could. I really
loved meeting the alumni with you and showing them our date wall in our
room. It gave me hope that we could be an alumni couple some day which I
know is pretty intense for us having been together for only a few months
but it somehow felt a lot longer than that at the time. Even now the
idea of us having been together both feels impossibly long and yet too
short to really capture how close we are. Being with you just feels
right. And like it should be a part of my life, hopefully for a while.
It was also really nice that you were able to stay on campus longer and
we could spend more time together before we had to be apart for the
summer. I’m sorry I interrupted that time because I had to go see my
dad, but I was really glad that was quick and that I was able to come
back.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-7-2-month-mondo" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 7: 2-Month Mondo</h3>
<p>I think this was the first date I had the idea for, which is probably
why it was kind of a boring one. I wanted to do something to celebrate
us being together for 2 months which isn’t that long but I was happy
about it anyway because I loved you (and still really love you) and like
celebrating that you love me too. It was nice to eat pizza with you even
though we ended up outside on the bench again. I don’t think we’ve ever
actually had Mondo inside Mondo except during Anne’s party which is
kinda weird to think about since we’ve gone a few times now. This is
also the first date so far that I don’t have in my calendar which is
kinda weird because I know we planned it out a bit and I remember having
gone. I remember this being one of the last things we did together
before we had to be long-distance, which is a bit of a sad association,
but I’m really glad that we got to have one last date before the summer
pulled us apart.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-8-museum-of-natural-history" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 8: Museum of Natural History</h3>
<p>I loved looking at rocks with you :) And seeing the silly Easter
island head from the Night at the Museum movie. And just exploring the
museum with you. I’m sorry we had to pause for me to deal with Kyle
being locked out of his room though. I wish I could’ve paid more
attention to you the whole time because I love you and I love going
places with you. I know you’ve been there a ton of times too, so thank
you for still wanting to bring me to it and show me all the things you
like about it. I was really glad that you shared it with me.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-9-1-gnocchi-4-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 9: 1 Gnocchi 4 2</h3>
<p>Bella Luna! I remember the music there was kinda weird and I kept
getting distracted by it. And how you felt weird about being college
students who only bought one meal at the restaurant and how you thought
they probably didn’t like us. We give them a good amount of business now
though so I think they do like us probably. It was nice to eat out with
you since we don’t do that a lot and it was kinda fun to be a bit
spontaneous and get pasta randomly early before I had to take the train
home. I really like doing things like that with you. Just deciding we
want to do something and then doing it. It’s nice to plan things out too
but theres something nice about liking each other enough to trust
spontaneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-10-train-surprises" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 10: Train Surprises</h3>
<p>Thank you for coming to meet me at Penn Station and bringing pasta.
It was so nice to eat with you and steal some time together before I had
to go to New Jersey. I missed you a lot that weekend and having any time
with you always feels really important and good. Especially now that
we’re long distance I appreciate time with you in a really different
way. I thought it was basically going to be the same as the summer but
this is a lot harder. I’m glad we were able to see each other so much
over the summer even though we were in different places most of the
time. And that we still get a lot of time together now despite
everything. I really love you and I love spending time with you. I’m
excited to keep adding more dates to this list with all of the cool
stuff we do while we’re in Europe.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-11-cone-sharing" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 11: Cone Sharing</h3>
<p>Thank you for introducing me to new food. It always makes me really
happy when I can share stuff with you, especially when it’s stuff you
love. It was also really nice to see the ice cream shop that you went to
as a kid and to have you teach me the dangerous life skill of eating ice
cream from a cone without having it drip too much. I hope that we can
share more ice cream cones again. Strawberry and chocolate ice cream go
pretty well together which reminds me of us because we love those things
and each other and we go pretty well together too :)</p>
</div>
<div id="date-12-pancakes-and-milkshakes" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 12: Pancakes and Milkshakes</h3>
<p>This was another one of those fun “yeah let’s do it!” moments. I was
happy that I got to introduce you to something that I knew from
Singapore, since I feel like those moments are pretty rare since
Singapore is all the way on the other side of the planet. And that we
got to share a crazy milkshake. And that I was able to make you pancakes
and bring them to you to have lunch together when you were going to
school. It was really nice to be your house boyfriend over the summer. I
really like eating with you and cooking for you. And I was glad that you
had some time to spend with me during lunch becasue I know that course
was really really hard and I really appreciate that you made time to
spend with me despite everything you had to do. I wish I could’ve been
there more to take care of you, but I was glad I was able to make you
lunch towards the end of it at least. This date was a bit earlier on
though. It was when my train got delayed by two hours and it was late at
night so I decided to say I was sick and not go to class and stay an
extra day with you. I’m really glad that I was able to get so many
surprise long weekends with you. Every extra day means the world to
me.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-13-the-met-part-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 13: The Met Part 1</h3>
<p>I was so excited to go to the Met with you. I really liked seeing
turtle pond with you and walking thorugh Shakespeare’s garden and
getting dressed up. I’m glad that you wanted to share the Met with me
and you told me so much about all of the statues and that you were
patient with me even though I had to keep sitting down on benches a lot.
I hope it wasn’t too frustrating for you. You’re always so nice to me
with things with my knee. I appreciate it a lot because I feel like it’s
annoying or a burden for other people sometimes but you never make me
feel like that. You always make me feel loved and wanted.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-14-subway-exploration" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 14: Subway Exploration</h3>
<p>Red mango! The financial district! The container store! This was so
much fun :) Thank you for entertaining my silly idea of just travelling
on the metro to random places. And for showing me red mango. They had
such good frozen yogurt. The smoothie was so good too. I really
understand why you liked it so much. I hope we can go back there
together sometime over the summer when we’re back in the US. I hope we
can have so many more smoothies together. Thank you for introducing me
to so many amazing things like smoothies and the container store and so
so many other places and foods and for being so patient with me and
helping me try stuff. The world feels easier to navigate when we do it
together.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-15-date-tist" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 15: Date-tist</h3>
<p>This was just silly. Still sad I didn’t get to meet your actual
dentist. But it’s pretty amazing that you’ve got such good teeth. I’m
proud of you for that :) Also, thank you for bringing me to things like
your dentist appointments and other mundane parts of life. It makes me
really happy that we get to be there for things like that for each
other. Like we’re really connected. And we still have fun together even
when we do things like bring you to the dentist. We must really love
each other :)</p>
</div>
<div id="date-16-hadestown" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 16: Hadestown</h3>
<p>I know you’re not really a musical guy, so I was super surprised when
you wanted to see Hadestown, for your birthday no less. It was really
amazing to go to a fancy Broadway musical with you, and I was especially
excited about you wanting to see it because it felt like a good way to
combine our interests, even though it wasn’t really accurate to the
original myth. Thank you for letting me rant about the technical aspects
of the show too. I hope that you really did like coming to see this. I
liked walking around and getting ice cream with you afterwards (twice!
fancy rose and Ben &amp; Jerry’s) and how we kept postponing returning
home because it didn’t feel right to call it a night yet. Going out with
you is really fun.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-17-reading-together" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 17: Reading Together</h3>
<p>I love reading with you. It’s really nice to do things separately but
also be together. And talking to each other about what we’re reading and
pointing out the silly parts to make each other laugh. I wish you were
able to read a book you wanted to read and not a book for class, but
hopefully we’ll read together again and then we can both read fun books
and tell each other all about them.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-18-town-exploration" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 18: Town Exploration</h3>
<p>This was a better idea in theory than in practice unfortunately :( I
think it ended up going okay though in the end. I’m sorry it wasn’t
better though I wish we had been able to do all the stuff we planned on
doing.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-19-haicut-x2" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 19: Haicut x2</h3>
<p>Thank you for showing me All People’s Barbershop. And for being so
patient with me when I was too scared to go to a barbershop. And for
still loving me when I cut my own hair and it looked horrible. You’re
really sweet to me and so patient and so kind and so much more than I
could’ve ever asked for. I’m so grateful that you’re a part of my
life.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-20-lovers-club-fair" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 20: Lovers Club Fair</h3>
<p>I really like when you have date ideas like this. Where we do normal
things like the WSA debate moderation or a club fair and just make them
dates because why not. It’s really fun to go on so many dates with you
that aren’t really conventional but feel wonderful because you’re there.
It makes whatever we’re doing seem better. Being around you makes me so
happy, no matter where we are or what we’re doing.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-21-fake-fancy-gnocchi" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 21: Fake Fancy Gnocchi</h3>
<p>I’m proud of the silly fake fancy set-up I had for this, even though
it ended up not working how I imagined really. It’s always nice to cook
for you and eat with you. And it makes me really happy when you like the
food I make. I want to eat pasta with you for a long time. I know this
was not a Bella Luna date but it was gnocchi which reminds me of Bella
Luna and makes me excited for us to have Bella Luna when we go back to
the US.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-22-pasta-reunion" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 22: Pasta Reunion</h3>
<p>It was really nice to come back from Pace and eat pasta with vodka
sauce with you. I missed you so much while I was gone and it was super
sweet of you to go and get us pasta :) You’re so nice to me all the
time. It’s also really nice to eat together in bed and then watch TV and
eat ice cream and cuddle afterwards because the ice cream was too cold
and now we’re shivering and need to warm up. I love having calm pyjama
nights in with you. You make me so domestic and so happy. I love
you.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-23-dnd-joe" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 23: DnD Joe</h3>
<p>Silly silly joe. Jow. Jhow? Did we ever figure out a spelling for
that? Oh well. I liked seeing this with you. It was fun that it was
interactive too, and that we got to joke around with the actors. They
were really nice and fun. The cult part was silly too. I really like
your jokes, and I was glad I got to hear a bunch when we were there in
the beginning. I hope we get to watch a lot more Joes (Jows? Jhows?)
together and laugh at his silly jokes. Joekes. Haha!</p>
</div>
<div id="date-24-spooky-library" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 24: Spooky Library</h3>
<p>This was a really fun spooky library tour. It was also nice to be
able to bring Talia along, even though that kinda ruins the date factor.
It’s normally fun when the three of us hang out and it’s always good to
get her out and interacting with people. It was also cool to learn more
about the library and to get grilled cheeses together. Whey stationary
is such a fun restaurant. Thank you for showing me that. And for
inviting me to the see the spooky library tour. I liked the staircases
that led nowhere.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-25-gay-greeks" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 25: Gay Greeks</h3>
<p>I can’t believe how packed this talk was. It was interesting for me
to be at though, and I’m really glad that you wanted me to come with
you. I like learning about the things you like, and hearing your
thoughts about things you’ve learnt that I’ve seen too. It’s always
really cool for me to get the perspective of whoever is talking and then
your perspective on the same topic because I feel like you know so much
about so many things and always have cool thoughts to add. I love your
brain.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-26-masquerade" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 26: Masquerade</h3>
<p>God was this a terrible idea. I’m glad you still love me after I
suggested we go watch this awful awful show. I feel very lucky. It was
just so bad. But it was incredibly fun to rant about how bad it was with
you afterwards too. I love when we share frustrations and just keep
ranting to each other which makes the rant continue on and get stronger
and we have similar opinions and just get to vent our feelings about how
horrible something is. I really love doing everything with you.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-27-col-formal" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 27: COL Formal</h3>
<p>This was such a wild event. Sometimes I still wonder about if we
actually set off that alarm by exploring the building. Russell House is
a really weird place, and it was fun to wander around it with you. And
to meet your COL classmates.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-28-painting-show" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 28: Painting Show</h3>
<p>Thank you for coming to this with me even though you had a ton to do
for astronomy and your huge final project. It was really nice to see you
for a bit and share a smoothie. I like looking at art with you. It
doesn’t feel nearly as interesting when I’m looking at it on my own.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-29-library-dayvisa-appointment" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 29: Library Day/Visa Appointment</h3>
<p>I’m sorry I was so stressed for most of this date, but thank you for
letting me use your library card to print and for introducing me to the
cool NYPL system! The libraries are so big. I still think about how the
librarian thought we were both under 18 sometimes because it’s both
funny and painful. Thank you for coming with me to the visa appointment
as well. I’m sorry you had to wait outside though. You’re always really
nice to me. I hope that I can help you as much as you help me.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-30-bookstore-barnes-noble-edition" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 30: Bookstore (Barnes &amp; Noble Edition)</h3>
<p>I’m glad we’ve had so many book related dates. It’s really fun to
look at books with you and talk about them. I don’t really recommend
books to anyone and it’s nice that you listen to me talk about all of
them and sometimes spoil them if you think you probably won’t read them.
It makes me happy when you seem interested in book plots that I’ve
really liked too. You’re really sweet for listening to me poorly explain
their plots. I really like hearing about the books you’ve read too,
especially since they’re so different from what I normally read. I hope
that someday I can read all of the books you’ve told me about because
they all sound really cool and I think you have really good taste in
books and I’d love to see why you enjoy the books you enjoy.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-31-the-met-part-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 31: The Met Part 2</h3>
<p>Thank you for pushing me around in the wheelchair, and for coming
with me to some of the weirder exhibits like the musical instruments
part. I hope it wasn’t boring for you to see those things, since I know
you’ve been to the Met a lot. I really like going to museums, and
specifically the Met, with you thought. I love seeing how excited you
get, and learning about so many interesting things with you. It was also
nice to be able to try out using a wheelchair with you because sometimes
walking around is really hard and I want to be able to spend a lot of
time with you in places that you really like. I’m sorry that it got hard
to push me around though. I’m always happy to wheel myself too so please
don’t feel like you have to. Thank you for helping me with it anyway. I
liked seeing the little house part of the museum too, and it was fun
that there was an accessible portion there. Thank you for taking me to
see so many of the things you think are cool. I think they’re pretty
cool too, but that you’re the coolest of all.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-32-little-lego-guys" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 32: Little Lego Guys</h3>
<p>It was so fun searching for tiny versions of us with you and
struggling to find the perfect clothes and hair (and failing and finding
the best available ones). I’m always really happy when I look over at
mny desk and the lego version of you is sitting there. It feels like you
can’t really be that far away.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-32-plane-date" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 32: Plane Date</h3>
<p>It was so sad when you had to leave in the airport, but I’m glad we
got to have one last date in the US before we left. I liked sharing
milkshakes and fries with you at Shake Shack, and walking around and
looking at all the random airport things. I’m really glad you were able
to get your wallet before we left though that was spooky. I’m also glad
I was able to be there with you in the airport and you were there with
me because being together is always really nice and airports are spooky
and sad alone.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-34-pizza-abroad" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 34: Pizza Abroad</h3>
<p>I was really happy when we did this. It felt amazing to be able to
find little things we could do together that made us feel less far
apart. Eating different pizzas in different places at the same time was
really nice. And pizza is really good so that probaby added to my
happiness a bit too. I find a lot of comfort in doing things like eating
at the same time or going to bed at the same time so I’m super glad we
were able to start doing that with a few things sometimes. I hope it
brings you comfort and makes me feel less far away too. The distance is
really sad sometimes.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-35-no-mans-sky" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 35: No Man’s Sky</h3>
<p>I love that I get to see your avatar and give you little space kisses
and explore your bases and we can show each other all the cool stuff
we’ve found but do our own things too. Playing No Man’s Sky with you is
super fun and I’m sorry that it gets really frustrating sometimes and
crashes a lot when we play multiplayer and doesn’t work sometimes but I
hope that it’s still fun for you despite those issues. If it’s not we
don’t have to play it but I really like having something to do with you
where I can pretend I’m looking at you.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-36-no-mans-sky-the-sequel" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 36: No Man’s Sky the Sequel</h3>
<p>Boyfriend game! Thank you so much for getting this game for me before
we left. I really love it. Not as much as I love you, of course.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-37-classics-day" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 37: Classics Day!</h3>
<p>The Ashmolean museum is no Met, but I still really liked it. It’s
always fun for me to go to classics related things with you because I’ll
learn so much about the stuff you know about. It makes me never want to
do my own research about it because I like hearing about how you explain
it (and sometimes people believe in evil and wrong things and I don’t
want to accidentally do that so I’m very glad that you are kind enough
to tell about which things are super duper wrong so that I don’t fall
into that trap).</p>
</div>
<div id="date-38-librariesbookstore-waterstones-edition"
class="section level3">
<h3>Date 38: Libraries/Bookstore (Waterstones Edition)</h3>
<p>I’m sorry I was too tired to really go into the libraries, but they
all looked really cool and thank you for showing me them and bringing me
to look at the buildings and going to the bookstore with me and showing
me cool books and buying me Orlando. I’m really happy that you share the
books you like with me. Reading them feels like I get to see a piece of
you.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-39-lmh-day" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 39: LMH Day</h3>
<p>Thank you for taking me to see the library and resting with me. It’s
always really nice to cuddle you. I’m sorry I push you out of the bed
there sometimes though. I promise I don’t mean to. If anything I would
want to pull you onto me. Nonetheless, I really like staying in with you
and cuddling. And feel free to give me a bit of a shove if I take up too
much space.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-40-no-mans-sky-the-threequel" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 40: No Man’s Sky the Threequel</h3>
<p>It’s silly that we counted so many of these as dates we would have so
so many dates if we kept doing that. Maybe we’d even get to 100 by the
end of studying abroad. Which would be really wild. But maybe that would
make everything else feel less special, so it’s probably better that we
stopped counting them as dates in the end.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-41-queer-oxford-and-brownie-sundae"
class="section level3">
<h3>Date 41: Queer Oxford and Brownie Sundae</h3>
<p>I was really surprised by how many people went to the Queer Oxford
museum night. And also how weird the music was. And how many people were
listening to it and seemed super into it. I know the museum was a bit
boring but I liked wearing silly hats with you and playing the
typhoidland games, even if they were super easy. I hope that you still
had fun even though it wasn’t a great museum. I had fun because I was
with you. I’m sorry I was so tired though. Thank you for taking me to
get a hot chocolate and a brownie sundae afterwards. It was funky how
their microwave didn’t work and the guy super burnt the brownie before
we got a proper one. I really liked the hot chocolate and the brownie
sundae though, and it was nice to sit and just enjoying eating ice cream
with you. I love when we do casual fun things like that together. I hope
we get to have lots more ice cream together.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-42-oxford-castle-prison" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 42: Oxford Castle &amp; Prison</h3>
<p>This was much more fun than I was expected! I like castles and you
like castles so I figured it would be cool even if the tour was bad but
Emily was silly and funny and the castle had funky prison stories and I
liked getting our mugshots taken and then stealing pictures of them (get
it that’s ironic because stealing is a crime). I still think about how
whacky those stairs were though. I’m glad that neither of us fell down
them because they were such a trick and so small and dizzying and I hope
we do not encounter other stairs like that during our normal lives.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-43-bookstore-part-2-waterstones-edition"
class="section level3">
<h3>Date 43: Bookstore Part 2 (Waterstones Edition)</h3>
<p>I’m sorry you were so tired for this and your phone was not with us
that was spooky and I’m sure made it hard for you to have a lot of fun
on this date but I hope that you enjoy the book. I’m happy that so many
of our dates have been to bookstores, especially Waterstones, because
it’s one of my favorites and I’m really glad to share it with you.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-44-valen-pi-nes-day" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 44: Valen-pi-ne’s day</h3>
<p>It was nice to walk the talk and eat pasta with you and celebrate a
second Valentine’s day with you :). I was glad that we were able to find
time to make up Valentine’s day twice since it was sad that we missed it
this first time. I hope that we’ll be able to celebrate it on the 14th
next year! It was fun to try the chocolates from the chocolate box with
you again too, especially since we were attempting to remember what was
in them. I also enjoyed hearing your commentary on the talk and the
stories she was talking about. I always really love learning stuff from
you, especially when it relates to other stuff we’ve done together like
watch Thor movies which are silly and fun.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-45-baby-statue-of-liberty" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 45: Baby Statue of Liberty</h3>
<p>I can’t believe there are so many statute of liberties in France.
It’s so wild that America just kept giving them back to France, and it’s
really funny that this is right by your Airbnb. Thank you for telling me
about this and taking me on a walk to go see it. I know it was hard for
you here the first week because France is evil and made you sick but I’m
glad we still got to do so much together and spend more time together
because of my classes being cancelled. It’s also really nice to go on
walks with you here. It makes me wish I could see more of Paris on my
feet.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-46-the-louvre" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 46: The Louvre</h3>
<p>I’m glad we went to the Louvre together. Thank you for pushing me
around this museum even though it was confusing and huge and crowded and
we got lost so many times. I’m sorry it was so exhausting but I’m glad I
got to buy you crepes afterwards. It was wild how we accidentally got
caught up in strike closures while on the metro though. France was a
really strange place to live when we were both there, but I’m glad you
were there with me for a part of it. It didn’t feel as overwheleming
when I knew we would go through it together.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-47-foucaults-pendulum-and-victor-hugos-house"
class="section level3">
<h3>Date 47: Foucault’s Pendulum and Victor Hugo’s House</h3>
<p>This was such a cool museum. Thank you for showing it to me. This was
my favorite museum that we went to out of all of the ones we went to in
Europe together. I loved seeing the little robots and the building
models and the pendulum. You always have such good ideas of places to go
:) Thank you for taking pictures of things for me and coming back to
show them to me when I was struggling.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-48-luxembourg-gardens" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 48: Luxembourg Gardens</h3>
<p>Thank you for coming to see this with me as a date even though
technically I went for class assignments. I had wanted to go and look at
it since I had been going to class right next to it but didn’t want to
go alone. I’m glad we shared a baguette and looked at the statues
together and held hands. It was a really nice moment and I really
appreciate that you came all the way there to see me during the school
day. I really love spending time with you however we can.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-49-musée-dorsay" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 49: Musée d’Orsay</h3>
</div>
<div id="date-50-frozen-food-feast" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 50: Frozen Food Feast</h3>
<p>It’s so cute much you loved Picard. I enjoyed that we were able to
have fun frozen food and make things fake fancy even though we had such
a tiny kitchen</p>
</div>
<div id="date-51-château-de-versailles" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 51: Château de Versailles</h3>
<p>The petit train! It was so small and cute :) And the gardens were so
pretty and cool even though it was cool (literally) and windy and hard
to be outside a bit. I liked discovering that you like hot chocolate,
but only the kinds I don’t like as much, which is another way we balance
each other out! I also always enjoy taking the big train so it made me
happy that we were able to take it together. I was happy that we got to
lose the group pretty easily and just hang out with each other because I
really wanted to spend time with you and make it a proper date.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-52-anniversary-cluny-museum" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 52: Anniversary Cluny Museum</h3>
<p>I’m really glad that there was a strike on our anniversary and I
didn’t end up having to go to class and that we were able to go to Cluny
instead and see a bunch of cool stuff together. I thought it was cute
how defensive you were of the art and statutes in the museum since you
said sometimes people think they’re simplistic or boring but you love
them. I love how passionate you are about all the museums you want to go
to with me :)</p>
</div>
<div id="date-53-basilique-de-saint-denis" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 53: Basilique de Saint Denis</h3>
<p>This was such a cool church. I still think about how the light was
reflecting off the windows and onto the floor and the pews and the walls
and how it was so pretty and colorful. I really liked seeing this with
you. It was such a cool building and it’s really fun for me to see all
the architectural stuff that you always tell me about.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-54-pantheon-louvre" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 54: Pantheon + Louvre</h3>
<p>Thank you for pushing me around this museum again. I know it’s really
exhausting and hard, but it’s really sweet of you to always do it
anyway. I liked how we got to see different parts of the Louvre. I’m
sorry that the vase section was still closed off :( I was really excited
for you to be able to see them after you loved your class on it so much.
I’m also sorry for crying in the Pantheon and getting frustrated and for
it being disappointing even though it was expensive. Thank you for being
nice to me about it all anyway.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-55-park-apple-bread-saint-chapelle"
class="section level3">
<h3>Date 55: Park + Apple Bread + Saint Chapelle</h3>
<p>I know you hated this church, but it was fun to go to apple bread
with you. I liked showing you my favorite sandwich restaurant in Paris
becuase you love sandwiches so much and I wanted you to get to have some
good ones while you were there with me. I’m glad that you liked it too.
I’m sorry that this date was so impromptu and we never found the train
tracks in the park. That was a really good idea you had and I would’ve
loved to see them with you. I hope we go to the NYC version you told me
about some day. It’s really cute how you try to find things I’ll like
when we go places. It makes me feel looked out for, and I hope you feel
looked out for too. I’m sorry you’re mostly the one coming up with
ideas. I hope that some of the stuff I’ve shown you has been good.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-56-apple-bread-part-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 56: Apple Bread Part 2</h3>
<p>Thank you for coming to visit me at school for our last week in Paris
(twice!). It was really nice to have lunch with you. I’m sorry my school
days were so incredibly long and I couldn’t really get home easily. I
like eating with you and sharing food a lot, so it meant a lot to me
that you would come all the way down to where I was just so we could eat
together. I hope it wasn’t too awkward that my professor also eats there
randomly.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-57-la-felicita" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 57: La Felicita</h3>
<p>You had lunch with me at school again :o And let me eat most of your
fries! You are way too nice to me most of the time. I want to give you
more of my food in return. We should always be sharing. I hope you liked
this place, even though they didn’t really have any pasta you wanted. I
know that was kinda disappointing and I’m sorry. You love pasta.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-58-herculaneum" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 58: Herculaneum</h3>
<p>This is probably one of my favorite dates, just because of how
excited you were the whole time. It’s really adorable watching you get
super into a place we’re visiting and start telling me a bunch of
information about it :) I love learning about the stuff you love, so
thank you for always sharing it with me. Even though the train ride was
really long and it was hot and so much walking, it was really fun to get
gnocchi and ice cream with you (so much ice cream!). The flavour you
picked at the train station gelato place was really good. I’m glad that
you’re helping me find new food I like, and always sharing it with me. I
like learning that there are lots of things I like, way more than I
expected, and that you like them too so we can have them together :) I
know you’re not a big fan of day trips, but I think this one was a good
one.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-59-roman-forum" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 59: Roman Forum</h3>
<p>This was so big and so much walking. That’s the main thing I
remember. But the buildings were pretty cool and there was a lot to see.
I know it wasn’t your favorite, but it was still cool that we got to go
the museum and stuff. I’m sorry I was really upset in the museum. I
don’t even remember why I was crying now, but I remember doing it, which
I’m sorry for because I didn’t want to ruin the museum trip for you.
It’s always fun to see statues and stuff together. I’m sorry my knees
make it hard for me to keep up with you during things like this and the
Herculaneum. I hope that it’ll be easier after I get surgery and we can
do more stuff together.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-60-etruscan-capitoline-collosseum" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 60: Etruscan + Capitoline + Collosseum</h3>
<p>I remember doing a lot of walking for this date too, and being forced
to sit down a couple times since it was such a long day. Rome really was
a ton of walking. I hope that the next time we do that much walking I
have working knees. The Etruscan museum was really fun, even though the
staff were a bit silly and overly nice about everything and also didn’t
speak English. I liked that there was so much we could see, and how
happy it made you to see all of it. It was also really good that we were
away from the crowds. I hope that helped you relax a bit more. I’m sorry
Rome was so crowded all the time and getting tickets for stuff was so
incredibly difficult. I hope you still enjoyed it. I enjoyed being there
with you, and especially eating all of the gnocchi that we had. I can’t
believe the final gnocchi date we had before we went to drop me off at
the train station wasn’t recorded as a date :( I must have forgotten to
ask if it was one in the midst of all the being sad. But going to that
restaurant and eating that gnocchi was incredible, and it would be a
shame to leave something that good off this list of cool things we did
together while traveling.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-61-lego-star-wars" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 61: Lego Star Wars</h3>
<p>Thank you for playing this game with me so many times. I can tell
it’s not really your favorite, and it’s okay if you’re a bit tired of
it, but I appreciate that you played with me because I like it even if
you don’t really. I like playing video games with you a lot. I hope we
can find some more that you like too so we can keep playing new games
together.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-62-pizza-express-the-owl-house" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 62: Pizza Express + the Owl House</h3>
<p>I’m glad that you liked this show :) I really liked watching the Owl
House the first time I saw it, and I really wanted to share it with you
because it was good and fun and gay and that’s just like us! It was
really nice to watch it again while cuddling you and eating pizza
together. You’re also really cute and silly for always giving me extra
dough balls because you know I like them so much. Thank you for getting
Pizza Express so many times while I was in Oxford even though it’s a bit
expensive to do that often. I hope we can get Bella Luna again together
a few times once you’re back in NYC. I like our dinner + movie/TV show
dates a lot. Hopefully we can do a better job at coming up with stuff to
watch, but it’s a bit hard now that we’ve sort of exhausted both of our
lists.</p>
</div>
<div id="date-63-lon-date" class="section level3">
<h3>Date 63: Lon-Date</h3>
<p>I enjoyed going to the bank museum with you :) It was fun to get to
see the history of the bank and do puzzles together and try to control
inflation. It was a really nice museum, and I’m glad that we went to
London even if the rest of the trip was disappointing. I’m sorry about
how much the British Museum sucked. I was really excited to see more
cool Greek and Roman art with you but British people :( I hope you don’t
regret going. I’m also sorry about how much the bus ride sucked, but I’m
glad that we were together for it. I hope you’ll lean on my shoulder
many many more times and we have lots more chances to be so so sleepy,
but preferably in a bed.</p>
</div>
<div id="bonus-note" class="section level3">
<h3>Bonus Note</h3>
<p>Writing all of these out and making the calendars and the graphs and
the maps was a really nice way to look back on our relationship and
realize how much I really enjoy doing stuff with you. Whether it’s
sitting in bed watching TV or playing video games, travelling even
though it makes us tired and grumpy, exploring a museum, watching a Jow,
or anything else we do together, I always love being with you. Even if
we’re tired or sad or it doesn’t go as expected, it’s nice to make
memories with you and have things we can look back on and complain about
together. I hope that we get to go on many many more dates. I love you
so much. I hope that you liked our dates as much as I did.</p>
